// Here is our Research File for all research tasks

// Nicolas Section Begin
//    -For research done for our android application I have been looking at what design pattern or
//      patterns to better structure our code.
//    -I have also been looking into the SOLID Principles and evaluating the code that I have written
//      so that I can follow these practices.
//    -When looking into Design patterns I have decided on using the Facade pattern moving forward.
//    -Using a Facade design pattern will help us have a front end to show for the user to use on the
//      application while hiding the complexities of the conversions and calculations in the background.        
//    -With my research done I will be in a better position to produce well written code and finalize
//      a structure to complete the application.
