// Matthew - Design Pattern Implementation Research
// - I am conducting this research to find a design pattern that would work best for our project. 
// Then, implement the researched design pattern into our project during sprint 3.
// - I expect to learn a design pattern that will be the best fit for our converter/calculator code part of the project.
// - Write the converter/calculator code to implement the design pattern that is chosen.
// - In sprint 3, a design pattern will be decided upon and implemented into our project.
