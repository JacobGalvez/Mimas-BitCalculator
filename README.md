## Sprint 1 ##
### Jacob Galvez
* Created Hexadecimal -> Binary function, and created Hexadecimal -> Decimal function.
* Also created mathematical operation functions (+, -, *, /) so that a user can operate on different number bases.
* BIT-13, BIT-14 (conversion functions) - https://bitbucket.org/cs3398-s22-mimas/bitcalc/commits/4aff2b832ee51487a7d1075a9864d2616a273cc0
