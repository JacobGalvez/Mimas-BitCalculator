// Jacob - Design Pattern Impelementation Research
//  - We are conducting research so that we can implement a design pattern into our code. We wanted a running application
// and now we want to improve the extendability and design to our code.
//  - From my research it looks like the facade design pattern is one we have been somewhat following on our own.
//  - I believe if we tweak some things around we will be able to smoothly implement this design.
//  - The facade design pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interace to a library,
// a framwork, or any other complex set of classes.
//  - Having a facade is handy when you need to integrate your app with a sophisticated library that has dozens of
// of features (our calculation, history, and conversion features), but you just need a bit of its functionality
//  - An example of a facade class is when you call a shop to place a phone order, an operator is your facade to all
// the services and departments of the shop, so you need an operator to be able to access all the other classes.
//  - So using that analogy, the operator is the homescreen which allows the user to gain access to the conversion,
// calculator, and history side of things. The user must always go back to the homescreen (operator) if they want
// to access another part of the application.
//  - In short, a facade has a "master" class which allows access to other functions in other classes.
